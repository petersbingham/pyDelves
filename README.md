Python Implementation of the Delves Routine
This forks the routine in https://github.com/tabakg/potapov_interpolation. Github user tabakg is credited with providing the original routines. These are contained within the second commit for purpose of comparison.
Work in Progress. Will eventually be an installable python package.
